# Password Generator - Homework #3

This application is the third homework assignment through the DU Coding Bootcamp. In this assignment, I was tasked with developing a password generator, that takes in a series of prompts from the user. The focus of the assignment was primarily backend work, so credit is owed to DU for providing the index.html and style.css sheets, as well as some elements of the script.js file.
